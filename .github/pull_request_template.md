Fixes #N
<!-- One line per issue this PR completes, each on its own line; an attribution line (e.g. Claude Code's 🤖 line) may follow. A PR that delivers one part of a larger
     issue closes that part's sub-issue: "Fixes #sub", then "Refs #parent".
     Never write fix/close/resolve + #N in a sentence or a table: GitHub links it and closes that issue. -->
